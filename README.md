# ARcade
 
- ARcade is an augmented reality-based, tower defense videogame I developed as my solo senior project
- Players control and move two laser gun "towers" that are spawned in on trigger images to shoot down waves of enemy robots that are trying to attack your home base
- The more robots you defeat, the higher your score rises, but if too many robots make it to your home base, the base will be destroyed and you will lose
- The game was developed to be an endless arcade game where you try to score as high as you can
- ARcade was made within Unity with the coding done in C#, modeling done in Blender, soundtrack produced in Ableton Live, and the AR image tracking done with Vuforia Engine
